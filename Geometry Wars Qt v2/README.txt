-I wasn't able to get SFML to work in NetBeans, so I worked in Qt Creator. Here is a video of the project: https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=6x-_Kyscs4U

-Controls: I recommend using an xbox 360 controller, as movement is more fluid.
Keyboard: 
	  WASD: Movement
          Arrow keys: firing
Xbox 360 Controller:
          Left thumbstick: Movement
          Right thumbstick: firing
