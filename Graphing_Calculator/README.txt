Rudimentary Graphing calculator created for as a school project in Object Oriented Programming II.
Things to note:
-This was my first implementation of inheritance.
-I utilized the shunting yard algorithm to handle expressions.
-This was one of my first times using SFML, so my implementation was messy, but functional

To use:
Enter an expression using the (),*,/,+,-,^ operators and press enter to solve.
Write a function using x as a variable to graph.
ex) (x-2)^2 + 2x -3
